# GeoCausal-SHAP
Dataset and algorithms used for my experiments of my master thesis related to SHAP calculations: GeoCausal SHAP - A Geovisual Analytics Framework for Explaining AI Combining SHAP and Causal Discovery

When testing GeoCausal SHAP, using the dataset I provide in the dataset, and altogether four .py files (GeoCausal SHAP.py, Causal_discovery.py, shap_explainer.py, utils.py) at the same time, datapreprocessing methods for datasets are all in the GeoCausal SHAP.py, you can choose different datasets for testing in the load dataset part. Changing different causal discovery mode, shap calculation mode, and predition model in the config as well.

Environment file is also provided.
